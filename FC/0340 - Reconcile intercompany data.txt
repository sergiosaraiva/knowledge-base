Intercompany matching
Intercompany Matching page is used for "matching" transactions between the companies in a group for the purpose of elimination and reconciliation. Intercompany matching is necessary when there are differences in intercompany transactions. Reasons for intercompany differences include:

Invoice booked by one company and the corresponding purchase not booked by the other company
Companies ending their fiscal year at different dates
Impact of currency rates on intercompany transactions
Transaction with a turnover on one side and a purchase booked as an asset on the other side
VAT not refundable

To access the Intercompany Matching page, click Consolidation > Consolidation > Intercompany Matching.

The left-side panel displays details on the intercompany matching/unmatching transactions as follows:
Rule - the intercompany elimination rule used for displaying the detailed information.
Company (above) - code, name, and the local currency of the company identified as the debit company for the debit transaction.
Company (below) - code, name, and the local currency of the company identified as the credit company for the credit transaction.
Under the company identification are all amounts that contribute to the reconciliation. This information is shown as a table with the following columns: Account - the account on which the amounts are booked, Journal - the journal code and category on which the amounts are booked, Entry - the journal entry number, Description - the journal description, Amount - the amount in group currency.

The right-side panel is where you use certain criteria to filter the intercompany information you want to display on the left:
Threshold - the amount under which any intercompany difference is ignored. Filter group box includes filters such as Unmatched Transactions, Matched Transactions, Exclude Equity Method and NC, Merge Debit and Credit amounts. Set Threshold allows you to limit the intercompany reconciliation to one specific Intercompany Elimination rule.

Set threshold
1. In the Threshold field, click.
2. In the Threshold window set the amounts at which the differences will not be displayed. There is one line for each Intercompany Elimination rule, meaning you can define different thresholds for different rules.
3. To save the modifications you make to the threshold, click.

Correct intercompany details
On this page, you can correct intercompany details. The Intercompany Rule, Company and Partner Company, including code, name, and local currency, are displayed. 

1. Search for the account on which you want to make the correction. Only accounts defined as Intercompany Accounts will appear on the list.
2. Enter the amount that you want to correct. You can choose to correct the difference in Group Currency or in the Local Currency of the company.
3. Click to add the difference amount to the Bundle Amount of the selected account. These modifications impact the statutory bundle of the company mentioned in the Company field, on the account selected in the Account field, and with the partner identified in the Partner field. The amount to be added can be indicated either in the consolidation currency or in the local currency of the company. Conversion to the consolidation currency will be carried out automatically if you choose to correct the amount in the local currency.
4. After modifying a statutory bundle to correct intercompany differences, carry out a new validation of the statutory bundle.

Generate Group Adjustment
1. There are three types of adjustments. Select one of them:
    - Transfer Difference: used for transferring the difference amount from the group transactions towards the out-of-group, or vice versa.
    - Reclassify Difference: used for reclassifying the difference found on an intercompany P&L account to a currency translation difference account.
    - Book Difference: used for booking the difference found on an intercompany Balance Sheet account to a translation difference account. The difference will be booked in P&L for the current period, and the adjustment will be counter-passed during the next period.
2. To set up these adjustments, click to redirect to the adjustment page. On this page, modify the “Posting journal” of the “IC-915-1”, “IC-915-2” and “IC-915-3” eliminations.
3. Set up the adjustments and click.
4. When finished, click to close this window and return to the main page.
