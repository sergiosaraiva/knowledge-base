The following amounts are displayed (as applicable) in their respective fields below: Adjusted amount - amount from local books including local adjustments done in Financial Consolidation. This amount should be justified by dimension, so it should be equal to the total of all values from the detail area. Local amount - amount from local books excluding local adjustments done in Financial Consolidation. This amount comes from the ERP, so it can be controlled by the end user with the local books. The difference between Adjusted amount and Local amount comes from the local journals. Justified amount - the total of all values filled in for the combination of company /account /dimension group, including values that are not directly visible (when there is a dimension 3 for instance or a long list of codes not directly displayed in rows /columns). Difference to justify - the difference between the Justified amount and the Adjusted amount. Click to save.
