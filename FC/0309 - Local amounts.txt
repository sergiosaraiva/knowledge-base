Local Amounts - Manual Data Entry
The Bundle Data Entry - Standard page is used for entering local amounts in the input form selected on the Local Amounts page. It displays the list of accounts added to the Standard form for the selected company and available in the database. The page can show data if it was already filled in or imported, or it can show zeroes if there is no data available for the selected company and included accounts.

The input form pages typically display the reference period in read-only mode (presenting data from the opening period, typically the last month of the previous accounting year), and data for the selected working or current period in read/write mode (if the period is not locked), and the difference between both columns.

The top part of the page displays the following parameters selected on the Local Amounts page:
Company - information about the company. It shows the code, the name, and the local currency of the company.
Option - layout option selected for the form.
Currency - code for the currency in use.
InputForm - code and the name of the input form.
