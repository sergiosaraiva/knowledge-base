Define mapping tables
The Define Mapping Tables page enables you to define mapping tables for the different structures used during an import: Accounts, Companies, Dimension Groups, Dimension Detail Codes, and Flows. A mapping table is used to establish a relationship between two or more sets of data, containing information about the data fields in the source and target systems and defining how data from the source should be transformed and mapped to the target system.

To access the Define Mapping Tables page, click Transfers > Data > Define Mapping Tables. The left-side panel displays a list of all the available mapping tables, including their Code and Name. The right-side panel displays the parameters of the mapping selected on the left side panel, including the following: Code - ID of the selected mapping table, Name - Name of the mapping table, Period - Consolidation period in which you want to work, Created by - creator of the mapping table, Modified by - name of the user who last modified the selected mapping table, Created On - date on which the mapping table was created, Modified On - date on which the mapping table was last modified. The structures you can use to create your mapping table are listed under the Period field and include Accounts, Companies, Dimension Groups, Dimension Detail Codes, and Flows.

Define a mapping table: Click . Enter the Code and Name of the mapping table in their respective fields. The Current Period is the default period in this field and can only be edited when you select an existing mapping to duplicate. Select a structure: Accounts, Companies, Flows, Dimension Groups, or Dimension Detail Codes. Click . All the items applicable to the structure you selected display in the Target table below, showing their Composed Code and Description. You can filter the list to display items With Source Only (with mapping data only), or the items Without Source Only (with no mapping data).

To map an item, click on the code in the Target table, enter a Code to identify that item on the source mapping table, the Mapping Factor (optional), and a Description. Click to add the item to the Source table. To duplicate a mapping table, select a mapping table from the list on the left-side panel, click , enter the Code and Name for the mapping table, select a different Period if needed, and click .

Define import/export file structure

Specify the file type (XLS, CSV, HUB), type of data, and additional options. For parameters, map the columns to the attributes and use functions like Substr/Merge/Prefix/Suffix/Fix. Enable import rules to transform the imported information.

Export file structure: Specify general export file properties, type of data, export options, parameters, and export rules. Create an export file structure by entering the file ID, selecting the Type of Amount (Net Amounts, Debit/Credit amounts), and file type (XLS, CSV, HUB). Specify the additional options and parameters. Enable export rules to transform the exported information.
